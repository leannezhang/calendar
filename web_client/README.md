This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

###

▢ Use JavaScript, TypeScript or Flow to create a Single Page Application in the
framework 1 of your choice2. (done)
▢ Include a README.md with instructions for how to run the app. Ideally, setup consists
of something like npm install && npm run start.
▢ In the README.md or through code commenting, please include any tradeoffs you
made (e.g. ran out of time so you didn’t do X) or decisions you’d like to explain.
▢ The calendar should render events in the “Monthly” view (see example below)
▢ The app should be URL driven. So visiting http://localhost:<port>/2018/4 should take
a user to April of 2018. Visiting an invalid URL should take the user to the current
month.
▢ Provide a simple P revious and N ext month button to allow navigation between
months. (done)
▢ Figure out a client-side algorithm for title launch placement within the calendar cells.
Use the events provided here as a sample. N ote that while the provided events are
finite, in practice the number of titles launched in a month are in the thousands.
▢ Fetch the provided events JSON from a simple node.js server.
▢ Figure out a client-side algorithm for how you will render the weeks and days.
▢ Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to render and style the calendar. Do not use the Table
element. While this is not a design position, we do look for a sense of design, so feel
free to make this look good, but if you find yourself up against the 4 hour mark, don’t
sweat it.
▢ Do not use : any UI component library (e.g. material-ui, react-datepicker).
▢ Do use: functional helper libraries (if you want), such as Lodash , Moment , or date-utils .

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
